# Hubitat-KasaTools

This Hubitat Environment application provides Kasa device tools useful but not incorporated into the normal SmartApp and driver.  This is an interim release and the future is integration into the Hubitat App for TP-Link integration.

There are three tools:

## Unbind Device from the Kasa Cloud
Allows user to remove cloud processing of the Kasa device (same as the old, but no longer available, Kasa App seting "Local Only".

## Bind Device to the Kasa Cloud

## Reboot a Kasa Device

To operate the tools, you will need the IP address and the type of device.
